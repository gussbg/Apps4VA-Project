        <h1> About The Source Awakens </h1>
        <p>
            In this project, The Source Awakens intends to show the trends in SOL scores and density of different ethnic minorities. For example, if a school has a higher percentage of African-American students, do these students perform better than schools with a lower percentage of African-American students? What are the average test scores of Asian students where a schoolâ€™s student body is composed of more than 50% Asian students? These are a few of the questions this project attempts to answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, there are many charts that help to answer these questions. The first chart shows the trends across years in SOL scores for a particular race as selected by the user. It compares these trends to the trends across years in the average score for a chosen school.
            The second chart shows the race composition of the school as a pie chart. As the race composition changes from year to year, the user can select which school year to see the composition for.
