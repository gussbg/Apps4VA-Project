           The school list allows users to select a specific school to observe the SOL trends for.
            The race drop-down menu allows users to select a certain race to observe trends for. We can compare these trends against the average SOL scores for the entire school. The user can select between the ethnic groups of Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, 2+ races, and ALL.

          The Gender drop-down menu allows users to select a specific gender to observe the trends for. The Gender drop-down menu contains the options Male, Female, and ALL.
            The Disability drop-down menu allows users to see the trends of students with disabilities. The user can select between the options of Yes, No, and ALL.
            The LEP drop-down menu allows users to see the trends of students with Limited English Proficiency. The user can select between the options of Yes, No, and ALL.

        <p>
            After choosing the type of students that the user wants to see the trends for, they can select the “Submit Query” button. The application will generate a chart that shows the trends of the type of student’s scores they have selected across several years for each subject.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The user will also see a drop-down menu of the school year. This drop-down menu helps in getting the race composition pie chart. As the race composition of the school changes from year to year, the user can see the race composition in the selected school for a specific year.
